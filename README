The Level3CacheClear tool provides easy access to the Level 3 HTTP Cache Invalidation REST API.

Requires the following gems:

openssl
base64
httparty
builder
optparse

Usage is simple.  Modify secretfile to include all of your Level 3 account specific information.

Formatting should be as follows.  See the samples in secretfile for more details.  Note that the scope does not include the Level 3 host property.
key=yourkey
secret=yoursecret
scope=yourscope (with no leading or trailing "/")



Run the script from the command line with the -p and -h options.

 -p is the path to invalidate
 -h is the host (or property) at Level 3

Example: ./cacheclear -p /path/to/invalidate -h hostname.com

Enjoy!
